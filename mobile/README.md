Near devs satisfying the technlogies searched will be plotted on the map. In this version back-end is configured to search devs until 10km limit. Future versions will offer the possibility to configure this option on front-end.

## Display Dev Info on Map
User can touch on the avatar and a baloon will be showed to display developer infos. 

## Github User Profile Access
Touching on the dev info ballon, user will be redirected to a screen with Github user profile page.
